1. Be able to create a project from a series of configuration files, where each
	file specifies a component of the ultimate project.
2. Maintain the look/feel of an open source project
	All source should be readable, and maintainable.  This includes any
	component configuration/description files
3. Turn into a full Verilog/C/C++ project
	Code should be "added" at appropriate points down stream
	Removing a component should just take appropriate code sections out
	later.

	Configuration files should consist of those data portions necessary
	to cut/copy/paste into a project to get it up and running.  The
	result should therefore be as though someone had configured the project
	by hand and included the new component, only that the auto-component
	compiler had done the configuration work instead.
4. Preserve the ability to have comments in the ultimate source code.  Such
	comments should be able to pass through the configuration files
